# project: customer-churn-prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

Description: This project aims to predict customer churn using deep learning techniques. The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.In this project, we will explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build a neural network model, and evaluate its performance.After building the model, we will also perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. The project will be implemented using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. The project will also include a detailed analysis of the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model will be saved and can be used for predicting customer churn in real-world scenarios.

Usage:
  - Train the model using the training dataset.
  - Evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
  - Use the model to make predictions on new data.

Accuracy:

After hyperparameter tuning, we achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset, which is a significant improvement over the initial model. The final model can be used to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
